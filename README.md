# Playwright-with-Java and Cucumber 
## Built and run on Intellij

This project includes a cucumber feature built using Maven Java and the Playwright binder library

For more details click here [Playwright using Java](https://playwright.dev/java/)

The tests are run as part of the build process, here on github. NB. Because this project uses features and scenarios rather than 'tests' the run cycle shows 0 tests run (Actions: run)), although a duration is sepecified demonstarting that the scenarios have indeed run.

By default the sceanrios are run in headless mode. To change this by setting setHeadless(true) to base in **BaseClass.java**

**To run using different browsers** change the browser value to one of: chrome, firefox or webkit in the file **config.properties**

When the feature file is run in intellij using the **junit test runner** (SauuceDemoTestRunner) the following cucumber report is generated. This generates the cucumber.json file which can then be used by the **maven-cucumber-reporting plugin** (defined in the POM.xml) to generate the Maven HTML Report, see further below
